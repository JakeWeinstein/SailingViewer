## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Full rewrite over incremental refactor — codebase too bug-ridden to patch
- [Init]: Normalized video storage (no JSONB blobs) — prerequisite for all downstream features
- [Init]: Three-role system (Captain/Contributor/Viewer) — first code change due to active JWT privilege escalation bug

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: iOS Safari Drive embed failures are outside app control — must test on a real device before phase sign-off; fallback UX required
- [Phase 5]: Presentation mode drag-reorder + sailor grouping interaction design is novel — validate with captain before Phase 5 planning
